These are practice problems from the start of my journey learning python. They are filled with issues and do not have any real coherence to them, besides the ones that 
I was working on during my Jetbrains academy courses. The rest are from YouTube video tutorials. I would credit/license the authors for thsoe videos but I have forgotten where
they came from, and am not using any of this code for monetary gain.
